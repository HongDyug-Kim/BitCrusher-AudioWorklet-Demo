# BitCrusher-AudioWorklet-Demo

Real-time BitCrusher DSP demo using Web Audio API and AudioWorklet.

---

This project demonstrates real-time DSP in the browser using the Web Audio API and AudioWorklets.  
I implement a BitCrusher effect (bit depth / sample rate reduction) and expose parameters for interactive control, showing how sound character changes in response to user input.  
The demo highlights the flexibility of custom nodes, low-latency processing, and practical patterns for UI-to-DSP parameter messaging.
